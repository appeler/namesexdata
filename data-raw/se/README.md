# Name and Sex of Swedish Politicians

These data come from all candidates for Swedish Parliament, county councils, and municipal councils. The raw data capture 198,539 Swedish individuals, resulting in 5357 unique first names (all characters before the first white space in their name). Each of these unique first names has an associated empirical probability of belonging to a female or a male, based on the related prevalence of men and women on the data with that first name.

The data are all generated by the Python script from raw files downloaded from [the Swedish electoral body here](http://www.val.se/val/val2010/statistik/index.html).
